Parameters for the BRD4-1, CREBBP and BAZ2B bromodomains


All structures listed here use the same reference pdb file from the tutorial on the BRD4(2) bromodomain (reference.pdb), which is also included here.

The variables to be changed, in comparison to the BRD4(2) tutorial input files, are given in separate .in files for each of the three other bromodomains.
